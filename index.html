            <h1> Ibby Hartley</h1>
           <p>Time never comes back, but it is interesting that all devices that we have to count it are the most repetitive. A clock, a hourglass, a cuckoo etc. But this hourglass is different. This one does not repeat. This will be stopped in the good days that I was here so you can remember me.</p>
<p> Also, a friend once said:</p>
	<p>"Ibby Hartley, a force to be reckoned with<br>
	On the road, her driving style is brisk<br>
	Fearless, focused, and always on the move<br>
	Her aggressive approach, a driving groove<br>
	But that's not all, for she runs a business too<br>
	An apparel venture, with style and hue<br>
	Creative and bold, her designs are chic<br>
	Ibby Hartley, a woman of great mystique"</p>
	<p>With ambition and passion, she sets the pace<br>
	Her determination, a true winning grace<br>
	She dares to dream and take the lead</p>
	<p>So let us all hail this formidable soul<br>
	Who drives and designs with a singular goal<br>
	To excel and succeed, in all she does<br>
	Ibby Hartley, a true champion, because"</p>
